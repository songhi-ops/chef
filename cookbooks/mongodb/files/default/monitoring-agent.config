# The global authentication credentials to be used by the agent.

# The user must be created on the "admin" database.

# If the global username/password is set then all hosts monitored by the

# Example usage:
#
# globalAuthUsername=yourAdminUser
# globalAuthPassword=yourAdminPassword

# Ability to disable the retrieval of the locks and recordStats information from

# You must be running a mongod process with built in SSL support. If
# this setting is enabled the `sslTrustedServerCertificates` setting below
# is required.
#
useSslForAllConnections=false

#
# Required only if connecting to MongoDBs running
# with SSL.
#
# `sslTrustedServerCertificates` is path on disk that contains the trusted certificate
# authority certificates in PEM format. The certificates will be used to verify
# the server certificate returned from any MongoDBs running with SSL.
#
# Certificate verification can be turned off by changing the `sslRequireValidServerCertificates`
# field to False. That configuration is only recommended for testing purposes
# as it makes connections susceptible to MITM attacks.

# Kerberos settings
# krb5Principal: The Kerberos principal used by the agent, e.g. mmsagent/myhost@EXAMPLE.COM
# krb5Keytab: The ABSOLUTE path to kerberos principal's keytab file.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1) You must set both of the following parameters to enable Kerberos authentication
#
# 2) Each monitored Host that is to authenticate using Kerberos must be edited in MMS to select
# GSSAPI as the Auth Mechanism.
#
# 3) The monitoring agent depends on 'kinit' to do the Kerberos authentication and looks for the
# executable at /usr/bin/kinit. Please ensure kinit is available at this location.
#
# 4) The KDC for this principal must grant tickets that are valid for at least 4 hours. The
# monitoring agent takes care of periodically renewing the ticket.

# to MongoDB Inc MMS servers.
